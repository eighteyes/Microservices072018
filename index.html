				<h2>
					Overview
				</h2>
				<p>
					<u>Microservices</u> is a term used to describe two things:</p>
				<p class="fragment">One, cloud servers which provide access to a single resource in a distributed computational system.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Two, an overall trend of computing moving away from large, monolithic codebases towards smaller, reusable components.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>
					Not talking about
				</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Specific platforms and frameworks.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Distributed computing. Not modular approaches in a single system. eg. Linux. </p>
				<p class="fragment">Containers (Docker, Vagrant) are generally used in production environments, not discussing. </p>
			</section>

				<h2>
					Simple Microservice
				</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Problem: My application can't search Twitter via a client side GET. They want me to use an API.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Solution 1: Building an external API integration into the application, manage authentication, and handle API keys in
					the same codebase.
					<p class="fragment">Solution 2: Microservice. 10 lines of server logic to search Twitter via a proxied GET call and forward the results.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Authentication is isolated, bad calls won't reach microservice, API keys are provided by the container at run time.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>
					Complex Microservice
				</h2>
				<p class="fragment">Problem: Client needs to compose results from Multiple Databases. User info is in Mongo, their transactional data is
					in SQL and the recommendation engine uses Neo4j.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Putting all this business logic into a single codebase is possible, but not easy to maintain or reason about. Long, intensive
					processes will lead to memory bottlenecks and server downtime.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Solution: Several Microservices, one for each database, connected via a Event-style messaging system to compose requests
					and return results.</p>

				<h2>
					Transactional VS Streaming
				</h2>

				<p class="fragment">REST / RPC - Send, Wait for Response</p>
				<p class="fragment">Two directional. External API, Database Access. Ordered Operations.</p>
				<p class="fragment">RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, Redis - Pubsub, Message Queue</p>
				<p class="fragment">One directional. Data Transformations and Processing. Ordered queues for workers. Distributed data ingestion. Operations
					in Parallel.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Microservices can be either, and a comprehensive system will incorporate both types.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>
					Approaches to Software
				</h2>

				<p class="fragment">Sequential - Machine Code, BASIC, GOTO</p>
				<p class="fragment">Procedural - Functions, Headers, Abstraction</p>
				<p class="fragment">Abstraction - Classes, OOP, Encapsulation</p>
				<p class="fragment">Functional - LISP, Clojure, Composing, Immutability</p>
				<p class="fragment">Microservices are generally a variant of the Interface Pattern, used to provide access to an underlying service without
					exposing underlying logic which permits decoupling.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>
					Maintenance
				</h2>

				<p class="fragment">Coupling is a measure of how vulnerable to change the connection between two software entities are. A "loosely coupled" connection
					maintains only the bare minimum of connection required to function, and thus, requires less cognitive effort to maintain.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">Traditionally, OOP classes incur a wide range of coupling costs, which usually increase as changes are made to the system.</p>
				<p class="fragment">Microservices encourages better software architecture, the edge between services forces a simple interface which can
					be easily documented and built upon.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>
					Scalability
				</h2>

				<p class="fragment">Consider a typical CRUD Over REST. Create Read Update Delete</p>
				<p class="fragment">In almost every application, Read will be used 99% of the time. Heavy use incurs a performance cost to clients who Create
					and Update.</p>
				<p class="fragment">A Microservice approach would make an stand-alone Read service and scale that indepedently of the other, less requested
					database operations.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>
					Important Considerations
				</h2>
				<p class="fragment">
					Logging - Lots of servers means it's more difficult to debug without intentional visibility.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					Edge Documentation - For developers to be functional in a microservices architecture, function, context, inputs and outputs must be clearly defined.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					Choice of Tools / Cloud Provider - Flexibility in choosing the right tool for the task. Not for cloud beginners. 
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					Tests - Without automated testing, your microservices will fail and burn.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					Local Development - Using containers, a developer should be able to reproduce the environment locally.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment">
					Health Check - At a minimum, microservices should include a health check endpoint for monitoring. Each cloud service has it's own approach.
				</p>
